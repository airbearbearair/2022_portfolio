            <p id="firstparagraph">	…to my page. My name is Erin Thomas. I am a multimedia artist from a small part of Delaware. This page serves to showcase art, poetry, and graphic design written/created from 2019 to 2022.</p>
            <p id="secondparagraph">	Some of my works include: “Working for the Knife by Mitski,” a poster design for the artist’s, Mitski’s new single, “Autumn Brings the Fall,” a poem, and “Ear to the Wall,” an abstract painting made with acrylic and water-based paint. Each of these items are what I consider to be some of my best work, but I hope you, the viewer, enjoy the whole of this gallery.</p>

Working for the Knife by Mitski is a song regarding the working class and how life wears the narrator down. The poster’s inspiration mainly draws on the music video released after the single.</p>

            <h2 id="aboutheader">ABOUT</h2>
            <p id="erinaboutdescription">	Erin Thomas is a sixteen-year-old artist from Wilmington, DE. Thomas has been attending an art school since the sixth grade as a Communication Arts major, which focuses on graphic design, photography, and all facets of writing. After creating so many works with these skill sets, Thomas got the opportunity to create a portfolio with this website.
                This index is a piece within itself. Presented with the challenge to brand themself, and capture themself within a few colors and fonts, Thomas chose neutrals and formal fonts that captured their nature as an artist and the warmth they try to release into the world. 
                Thomas has three cats named Peanut, Archie, and Luna. They play banjo and all types of guitar, and they are an avid enjoyer of classic rock anthems. They practice tarot and give out readings for fifty cents at lunchtime. :P</p>
