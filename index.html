            <p id="firstparagraph">	…to my page. My name is Erin Thomas. I am a multimedia artist from a small part of Delaware. This page serves to showcase art, poetry, and graphic design written/created from 2019 to 2022.</p>
            <p id="secondparagraph">	Some of my works include: “Working for the Knife by Mitski,” a poster design for the artist’s, Mitski’s new single, “Autumn Brings the Fall,” a poem, and “Ear to the Wall,” an abstract painting made with acrylic and water-based paint. Each of these items are what I consider to be some of my best work, but I hope you, the viewer, enjoy the whole of this gallery.</p>

            <p id="mitskipostercomment">“Working for the Knife, by Mitski,” a class project work inspired by the hit singer Mitski’s new album teaser. Working for the Knife by Mitski is a song regarding the working class and how life wears the narrator down. The poster’s inspiration mainly draws on the music video released after the single.</p>
