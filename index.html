            <p id="firstparagraph">	…to my page. My name is Erin Thomas. I am a multimedia artist from a small part of Delaware. This page serves to showcase art, poetry, and graphic design written/created from 2019 to 2022.</p>
            <p id="secondparagraph">	Some of my works include: “Working for the Knife by Mitski,” a poster design for the artist’s, Mitski’s new single, “Autumn Brings the Fall,” a poem, and “Ear to the Wall,” an abstract painting made with acrylic and water-based paint. Each of these items are what I consider to be some of my best work, but I hope you, the viewer, enjoy the whole of this gallery.</p>

                <p id="contentdescription">My artistic work is a result of a natural curiosity to work with every type of medium possible; in a display of my room, you will find ruined and graceless pieces made from everything including newspaper, inks, acrylics, oils, beads, pixels, and charcoal. It’s all about the texture. As long as a medium feels comforting in my hands, I will work with it. Here are some of my favorite works from 2019 to 2022.</p>

                <p id="paintingdesc">“Ear to the Wall” is an experimental piece finished in Feburary of 2022. It began as an old water-based painting from 2017 of eyes and ears of all shapes and sizes, and ended as a confusing mess of acrylic paints.</p>
                <!-- I would like to replace the poem with another work of art. But I have to take pictures. It's a work in progress. -->
                <!-- Okay the poem was replaced with another piece of graphic design! I'm very proud of it and proud of my page now too. -->
                <p id="poemfillerdesc">This piece, as a fanart cover for Stephen King's "Carrie," has no name. It is a 2019 piece created in Procreate on the iPad and edited in Photoshop.</p>

                <p id="dirttubdesc">“Dirt Tub” is a piece built from photos of dirt and weeds and an old bathtub. It was another school project. Adobe Photoshop was primarily used to create it.</p>

            <h2 id="aboutheader">ABOUT</h2>
            <p id="erinaboutdescription">	Erin Thomas is a sixteen-year-old artist from Wilmington, DE. Thomas has been attending an art school since the sixth grade as a Communication Arts major, which focuses on graphic design, photography, and all facets of writing. After creating so many works with these skill sets, Thomas got the opportunity to create a portfolio with this website.
                This index is a piece within itself. Presented with the challenge to brand themself, and capture themself within a few colors and fonts, Thomas chose neutrals and formal fonts that captured their nature as an artist and the warmth they try to release into the world. 
                Thomas has three cats named Peanut, Archie, and Luna. They play banjo and all types of guitar, and they are an avid enjoyer of classic rock anthems. They practice tarot and give out readings for fifty cents at lunchtime. :P</p>
